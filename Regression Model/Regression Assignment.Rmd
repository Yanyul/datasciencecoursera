#Motor Trend Analysis

##Summary
The dataset is a extract from 1974 Motor Trend US magazine compromises the fuel consupmtion and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance. 

```{r}
library(gglot2)

head(mtcars)
```

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

```{r}
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars,  
        xlab="Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)",  
        ylab="MPG - Miles/(US) gallon")
```

According on the boxplot chart, it's quite obvious that the mean and distribution of the Miles per Gallon (MPG) in manual transmission is higher than automatic transmission.
